# Razzle Dazzle Simulator

Razzle Dazzle is a carnival game that is known to be a scam. For information about
the game and its rules, see http://www.goodmagic.com/websales/midway/razzle.htm.

This simulator demonstrates just how great the odds are stacked against a player.
On average it would cost more money to win then there are atoms in the universe.

To run the simulator, see `simulator.rb`. The default is to play 1,000 games of
up to 5,000 rounds.
